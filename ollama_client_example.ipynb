      "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why water boils at 100 degrees Celsius under normal pressure. I know that boiling happens when a liquid turns into gas, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact conditions needed for that. Let me think through this step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I remember that when you heat something on a stove, it takes longer to reach the boil point than just pure water. That's why sometimes you have to reduce the flame to lower the heat. But that's probably because of other factors like pressure and surface tension. So maybe normal boiling is different from standard boiling?\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's the concept of atmospheric pressure. Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius when the pressure is around one atmosphere, which is about 1 bar or 100 kPa. If you were under a higher pressure, say at high altitudes where the air is thinner, water would boil at a different temperature because the pressure needed to reach boiling increases.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've heard before that as you heat something, it reaches its boiling point when the vapor pressure of the liquid equals atmospheric pressure. So for water, this happens around 100 degrees Celsius. But wait, what's vapor pressure? It's the pressure exerted by a substance turning into gas at a certain temperature, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "So if I have a container of water and heat it until all the water starts boiling away as steam, the temperature where that happens is 100°C when the pressure is atmospheric. But under lower pressures, like in a car tire, the vapor pressure would be less than atmospheric, so you'll need to heat more or lower the temperature.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I should also consider the surface tension of water and how it relates to boiling. Surface tension is a measure of the energy required to increase the volume of a liquid. When water boils, this surface tension plays a role in the movement of bubbles up from the bottom of the pot due to something called the Marangoni effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, why does the vapor pressure equal atmospheric pressure at 100°C? I think it's because of the way molecules interact under those conditions. At higher temperatures or lower pressures, the gas particles have more energy and can escape more easily, so you need a higher temperature to reach equilibrium with the liquid's vapor pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also recall that this is specific to water. Other liquids have different boiling points at standard pressure. For example, ethanol boils around 78°C, and glycerin around 163°C, which are lower or higher than 100°C depending on the substance. So water's special because it's unique in its molecular structure leading to this specific temperature.\n",
      "\n",
      "To sum up, boiling occurs when the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the atmospheric pressure. For water, that happens at 100°C under normal conditions, which is where it boils without needing additional heating unless other factors like increased pressure or lower surface tension are involved.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure (approximately 1 bar or 100 kPa) due to the balance between the vapor pressure of water and the atmospheric pressure. Here's a detailed explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Boiling Temperature**: At standard atmospheric pressure, water reaches its boiling point at 100°C. This occurs when the vapor pressure of water equals the atmospheric pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Vapor Pressure Concept**: Vapor pressure is the pressure exerted by a liquid as it turns into gas (vapor) at a given temperature. When this vapor pressure equals the ambient atmospheric pressure, the substance boils.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Surface Tension and Movement**: Water's surface tension influences how bubbles form and move up from the bottom of the pot due to the Marangoni effect, enhancing vapor transport as needed for boiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Unique Properties of Water**: Unlike other substances, water has a unique property where it doesn't follow the inverse relationship between temperature and volume as gases do at constant pressure. Instead, the vapor pressure increases with temperature, leading to specific boiling points for different liquids.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, under normal atmospheric conditions, water boils at 100°C because its vapor pressure matches the surrounding pressure, a unique property of water that sets it apart from other substances.\n"
